    # NOTE: Some patches are applied manually because they -do- apply, just not cleanly, ie with patch fuzz.
    # A detailed list of why the above patches are disabled is listed below:

    # winex11-_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW - Causes origin to freeze
    # winex11-WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING - Causes origin to freeze
    # user32-alttab-focus - relies on winex11-_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW -- may be able to be added now that EA Desktop has replaced origin?
    # winex11-MWM_Decorations - not compatible with fullscreen hack
    # winex11-key_translation - replaced by proton's keyboard patches, disabled in 8.0
    # ntdll-Syscall_Emulation - already applied
    # ntdll-Junction_Points - breaks CEG drm
    # server-File_Permissions - requires ntdll-Junction_Points
    # server-Stored_ACLs - requires ntdll-Junction_Points
    # eventfd_synchronization - already applied
    # ddraw-Device_Caps - conflicts with proton's changes
    # ddraw-version-check - conflicts with proton's changes, disabled in 8.0
    # ddraw-GetPickRecords - applied manually

    # dbghelp-Debug_Symbols - see below:
    # Sancreed — 11/21/2021
    # Heads up, it appears that a bunch of Ubisoft Connect games (3/3 I had installed and could test) will crash
    # almost immediately on newer Wine Staging/TKG inside pe_load_debug_info function unless the dbghelp-Debug_Symbols staging # patchset is disabled.

    # Compiler_Warnings - breaks some proton patches
    # ** ntdll-DOS_Attributes - disabled in 8.0
    # server-PeekMessage - eplaced by proton's version
    # server-Realtime_Priority - replaced by proton's patches
    # server-Signal_Thread - breaks steamclient for some games -- notably DBFZ
    # Pipelight - for MS Silverlight, not needed
    # dinput-joy-mappings - disabled in favor of proton's gamepad patches
    # ** loader-KeyboardLayouts - applied manually -- needed to prevent Overwatch huge FPS drop
    # msxml3-FreeThreadedXMLHTTP60 - already applied
    # ntdll-ForceBottomUpAlloc - already applied
    # ** ntdll-WRITECOPY - mostly already applied, needs specific manual patch
    # ntdll-CriticalSection - breaks ffxiv and deep rock galactic
    # ** ntdll-Hide_Wine_Exports - applied manually
    # server-default_integrity - causes steam.exe to stay open after a game closes
    # user32-rawinput-mouse - already applied

    # kernel32-CopyFileEx - breaks various installers
    # shell32-Progress_Dialog - relies on kernel32-CopyFileEx
    # shell32-ACE_Viewer - adds a UI tab, not needed, relies on kernel32-CopyFileEx
    # ** fltmgr.sys-FltBuildDefaultSecurityDescriptor - applied manually
    # sapi-ISpObjectToken-CreateInstance - already applied
    # ** user32-FlashWindowEx - applied manually
    # wined3d-zero-inf-shaders - already applied
    # ** kernel32-Debugger - applied manually
    # mfplat-streaming-support - already applied
    # ntdll-NtDevicePath - already applied
    # winspool.drv-ClosePrinter - not required, only adds trace lines, for printers.

    # ** winex11-Fixed-scancodes - applied manually
    # odbc-remove-unixodbc - not required, used for ODBC drivers for use with SQL applications, not gaming related.
    # ntdll-RtlQueryPackageIdentity - tests only, not used, do not apply cleanly.
    #
    # Paul Gofman — Yesterday at 3:49 PM
    # that’s only for desktop integration, spamming native menu’s with wine apps which won’t probably start from there anyway
